# On Love and Marriage

### Uncoditional love
I have often heard from people that one should love unconditionally. But I think that one cannot love unconditionally. Take for example, the case of a mother's love for her child. People say that such love is uncoditional. But, the love of a mother towards her child is conditional on the fact that the person receiving love is "her child". If it were not her child, then she would not have loved it. I think the more appropriate term should be "unexpectant love" instead of "unconditional love".

### Gold digger
I have seen many videos on youtube on the gold digger prank. Many people despise girls/women who seek men with good financial status. But why is this wrong? Isn't one supposed to look for a partner with positive attributes? People say that money is not a characteristic of a person, because money is a material object. But then what should a person love about another person? Should it be his/her personality? But then again, isn't personality a materialistic thing? I mean, isn't personality a characteristic of the mind/brain which the person received because he was lucky? If that is acceptable, then why isn't money (hard earned or inherited). This makes me think that we are not capable of loving another human being.

### Relationship and Marriage
In a relationship, one is not supposed to cheat on the partner. Even, one is not supposed to leave the partner for a better prospective. This is not because of love. This is because of commitment.
