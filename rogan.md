# Rogan Josh
I watched this nice video named Rogan Josh([youtube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r06uBlw0zj4)). The video is about the death of a fictional family in the 26/11 Mumbai terror attack([wikipedia link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Mumbai_attacks)). Please watch the video before reading further (for context).

After watching the video, many feel sad, thinking that had the family not gone to the hotel that night, they would have been alive. But, what about the goat that they were cooking? What about its life? How do people feel sad about people dying and not care about the animals they slaughter?

But then again, is the lion remorseful about the deer it kills?
