# Right and Wrong

I was having a discussion with a person one day. He said that the as long as we are not interfering with someone else's life, right and wrong is subjective (e.g. smoking and drinking). He said that the only thing absolute about right and wrong is whether we are intruding into other people's space. Everything else is relative about right and wrong.

But the very thing that he said is absolute about right and wrong might be wrong according to somebody else. Thus, that statement itself has relative value instead of absolute. Then how is it decided what is right and what is wrong?

It is said that right and wrong is decided by the laws. But then again, the laws are decided by what the majority think is right. E.g. cannibalism will not be allowed just because some person says that he/she thinks that cannibalism is right.
